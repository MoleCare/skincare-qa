Vulnerabilities go to **info@molecare.co.uk**, not a public issue.

Sized for a cheap cloud box (about **700 MB RAM**), not a GPU pod.

| Name | Job | Base (4-bit) | Size | Cloud tag | Harness |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `skincare-qa` | Skin-health Q&A | Llama-3.2-**1B** | ~700 MB | `llama3.2:1b` | MoleCare `skin-care-harness` |

MLX is only for **training on this Mac**. Serving is Ollama + a tiny Python sidecar. The sidecar has no weights.

```
client → harness :8080 → ollama (1B)
              ↓
     pass / revise / block
     block twice → fixed fallback
```

Same pattern as MoleCare's `skin-care-harness`: the model drafts, the harness decides
whether that draft ships. The harness is not a second model.

> **`skin-care-harness` is currently a private repository.** If you are outside MoleCare
> you cannot clone it, and the skincare rules below will not load. What that means in
> practice is set out in [Running without the harness](#running-without-the-harness).
> Making it public, or removing the dependency, is tracked in
> [#19](https://github.com/MoleCare/molecare-skin-llm/issues/19).

## Harnesses

| Surface | What it checks | On block |
|---|---|---|
| `/v1/skincare-qa` | MoleCare `SkinGuard` (no diagnosis, no "that's benign") | regenerate once, then the MoleCare safe fallback |

Skincare rules are **not** copied into this repository. They load from a sibling
`skin-care-harness` checkout (`packages/python`), or from
`SKIN_CARE_HARNESS_PYTHON` / `MOLECARE_ROOT`.

### Running without the harness

Without that checkout, `SkinGuard` cannot load, and the tests that exercise it
**skip rather than fail**. Everything else still runs: the data loaders and training.

Be aware of what a green run means in that case. A skipped safety test is not a
passing safety test, and this repository's central claim is that the harness stops
the model shipping a diagnosis. Treat a green CI badge here as covering everything
*except* the part that matters most, until
[#19](https://github.com/MoleCare/molecare-skin-llm/issues/19) and
[#10](https://github.com/MoleCare/molecare-skin-llm/issues/10) are resolved.

## Train (Mac / MLX 3.13)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MoleCare/molecare-skin-llm.git
cd molecare-skin-llm
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.13 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/build_data.py
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/train.py skincare-qa
```

Data for `skincare-qa` still comes from [molecare-mcp](https://github.com/MoleCare/molecare-mcp) + `molecare-webapp` (private). `molecare-ml` is image CNNs — unused.

## Serve (cloud or laptop)

Pull the tiny bases (you already have `llama3.2:1b`):

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:0.5b
ollama pull llama3.2:1b
```

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/serve.py          # 127.0.0.1:8080
PYTHONPATH=src python -m unittest discover -s tests -q
```

```bash
curl -s localhost:8080/health
curl -s localhost:8080/v1/skincare-qa \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"prompt":"What is the ABCDE rule?","red_flags":[]}'
```

Point the sidecar at a remote Ollama with `OLLAMA_HOST=http://ollama:11434`.

A 1 vCPU / 1–2 GB box is enough: Ollama holds the two 4-bit models, the harness is a few megabytes of Python.

## Chat through the harness

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/chat.py skincare-qa "what is ABCDE?"
```

## Save big artifacts on Hugging Face

Weights do not stay only on this Mac. After fuse, push to
[YauhenBichel](https://huggingface.co/YauhenBichel):

| Local name | Hugging Face repo |
|---|---|
| `skincare-qa` | https://huggingface.co/YauhenBichel/skincare-qa-1b |

```bash
hf auth login                  # or: huggingface-cli login / export HF_TOKEN=hf_...
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/init_hf_repos.py   # card only, creates the repo
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/fuse_and_export.py skincare-qa --hf
# or after fuse:
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/pull_hf.py skincare-qa
```

Repos are **private** unless you pass `--public`. The model card is written
from `cards/`. Adapters (small) use `--what adapters`; fused MLX weights are
the large folder.
